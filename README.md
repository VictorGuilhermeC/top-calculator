# Calculator — The Odin Project

This simple, functional calculator built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, was developed as part of ![The Odin Project – Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).

This project focuses on implementing core JavaScript logic, semantic HTML and CSS styling to build a clean, responsive interface.

## Features

- Basic arithmetic operations:

  - Addition

  - Subtraction

  - Multiplication

  - Division

- Two-line display:

  - Main display for the current input/result

  - Upper display showing the previous value and selected operator

  - Supports:

  - Decimal numbers

  - Chained operations (e.g. 5 + 3 \* 2)

  - Keyboard input (numbers, operators, Enter, Backspace, Escape)

  - Delete last digit

  - Clear all input

  - Error handling for division by zero

- Clean, minimal UI with:

  - Flexbox-based layout

  - Responsive button sizing

  - Visual distinction between digits, operators, and actions

## Design

- Layout built entirely with Flexbox

- Subtle shadows, rounded corners, and soft contrast for readability

- Custom color palette to differentiate:

  - Digits

  - Operators

  - Special actions (clear, delete, equals)

  - Font: Roboto, loaded via Google Fonts.

## Lessons Learned

- Managing application state

- Separating logic into small, focused functions

- Handling user input through both mouse and keyboard events

- Implementing conditional logic for chained calculations

- Using Flexbox to structure both page layout and button grids

## Future Improvements

As I continue progressing through The Odin Project, this calculator may be extended with new features.
